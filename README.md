## Features

- Control Canon cameras remotely via CCAPI.
- Expose camera functions over HTTP using FastMCP.
- Image compression and streaming support.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Canon camera with CCAPI enabled ([CCAPI activation guide](https://www.canon.com.au/apps/eos-digital-software-development-kit))
- See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Activate CCAPI on your Canon camera:**
   - Follow the official [Canon CCAPI activation instructions](https://www.canon.com.au/apps/eos-digital-software-development-kit).

3. **Configure camera IP:**
   - Set the `CANON_IP` environment variable to your cameraâ€™s IP address, or pass it as an argument.

## Usage

To run the server with Claude Desktop Client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Canon Camera Controller": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/dir",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CANON_IP": "192.168.0.111"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or with plain Python:

```bash
python server.py
```

## Extending the project
The license terms of CCAPI access do not permit sharing the API reference. 

Once you have access, it's quite straightforward to get it working.
